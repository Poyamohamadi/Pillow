### Working with Images in Python using Pillow

This notebook provides a quick introduction to image processing in Python with the **Pillow** library. It covers basic operations such as loading images, creating new ones from scratch, retrieving image information (like size and format), and simple manipulations like rotation.

Designed for beginners, it's a practical starting point for anyone looking to work with images in data science, machine learning, or creative coding projects. The examples run seamlessly in Jupyter Notebook, where images are displayed directly in the output.

Perfect for learning the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced tasks like image editing, augmentation, or preprocessing for deep learning models.
